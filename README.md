App Description: A golf website that allows users to compete against their friends on leaderboards. 
    - Allows users to create an account and log in to the site. *DO NOT USE SENSITIVE PASSWORDS WHEN TESTING, login is NOT ENCRYPTED* 
    - Once logged in, users can view, create, and join groups. Users in the same group will be able to interact with each other on the site.
    - The "Golf Courses" tab allows users to search for any golf course (uses golfcourseapi.com), see the results, and view more detailed information on the courses.
    - While viewing courses, users can see their round history for that course, and select a group from the drop down to see how their best score on that course ranks 
      against their friends on the leaderboard.
    - Users can also click "Input round score" while viewing a course to log a new score for that course.
